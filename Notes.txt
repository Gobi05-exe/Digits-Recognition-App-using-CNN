GUI using tkinter
window has two parts: 
1. drawing area
2. display prediction



drawing area must have three buttons: draw, clear, submit

draw -> we can draw the digit
clear -> clears the canvas 
submit -> submits the drawing and makes the prediction 

the prediction is displayed on a new window. if prediction is correct, save the image to the training data directory. the model will be retrained with the new image included.
